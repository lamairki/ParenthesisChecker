Git Component for C-Parentheses Matching Project

### Overview

The problem descriptions and details are on Prairielearn.
For the git component of the project, you will need
to commit and upload your code to this github repo.

Your score for the git component will be based on:
* Commit message quality.  This won't be judged that harshly, but
  random letters, primarily one word commit messages,
  or repeating the same commit message for each commit
  will lose you points.  I expect these to be something
  you could actually use to identify previous versions of your
  code.
* Number of commits (the point here isn't to have a bunch
  of commits, just to make sure you are committing along
  the way -- having only 1 or 2 commits will definitely
  lose you points).  I recommend committing after you complete
  different components of the code (for instance, commit after you
  read in correctly, etc.)
* Using git correctly:  you need to be using git correctly
  from the command line.  This means that you should not just
  be using the file upload option on Github's website.  Doing so
  will earn you no points for this portion

Note:  you only need to commit relevant .c or .h files (i.e.,
there is no need to commit the actual compiled program, just the
source code).  Typically the convention is to not inluded compiled
programs in repositories (at least not unless they are official released
versions of software).
